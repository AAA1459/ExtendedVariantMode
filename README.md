# Extended Variant Mode

A simple code mod for Celeste I did to play around with the IL manipulation capabilities of Everest. This allows to ~~break~~ change some things in the game mechanics... much like Variant Mode in the original.

Adds the following options to the Mod Options menu:
* Gravity (10% to 300%)
* Walk speed (10% to 300%)
* Stamina (controls Madeline's max stamina, between 0 and 300. 110 is the default)
* Dash speed (0% to 300%)
* Dash count (set any value from 0 to 5), can be used as a "No Dashing" variant
* (more coming)

## How to install

... just wait for the first release.
