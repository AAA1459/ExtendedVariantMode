# Extended Variant Mode

A simple code mod for Celeste I did to play around with the IL manipulation capabilities of Everest. This allows to ~~break~~ change some things in the game engine... much like Variant Mode in the original.

Adds the following options to the Mod Options menu:
* Gravity (10% to 300% of the normal gravity)
* Stamina (controls Madeline's max stamina, between 0 and 300. 110 is the default)
* (more coming)

## How to install

... just wait for the first release.
