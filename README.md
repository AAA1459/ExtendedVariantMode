# Extended Variant Mode

A simple code mod for Celeste I did to play around with the IL manipulation capabilities of Everest. 
IL manipulation basically allows code modders to inject their code (almost) anywhere in Celeste, and that can be used to modify some specific things in the game's engine... that's exactly what this code mod does.

This mod allows to ~~break~~ change some stuff in the game mechanics... much like Variant Mode in the original.

Adds the following options to the Mod Options menu:
* **Gravity**: affects falling speed, jump height and climbing
* **Jump height**: control the max height of Madeline's jumps
* **Walk speed**: affects all horizontal movement when going around
* **Stamina**: affects the ability to climb and grab
* **Dash speed**: modifies the speed of dashing (... duh)
* **Dash count**: disable dashing or give Madeline up to 5 dashes (also affects refills)
* **Ground friction**: make the ground more or less slippery everywhere

**Compatible with Everest 862 and later.**

## How to install

* Clone or download the repo
* Compile the project with Visual Studio
* Copy the directory `ExtendedVariantMode\bin\Debug` in the `Mods` folder located in the Celeste directory

or alternatively, wait for the first release on GameBanana.
